# The Power of One-Page Memos: Improving Communication in Open Source Food Pantries

## Overview

In the fast-paced, resource-constrained world of nonprofit food distribution, clear communication is essential. Yet, many organizations struggle with long email threads, vague requests, and disorganized meeting notes. One solution that has gained traction—even in some of the most high-performance organizations in the world—is the use of **one-page memos**.

This document proposes that open source food pantries adopt the practice of one-page memos as a core communication strategy—drawing inspiration from Amazon’s internal culture.

## Why One-Page Memos?

The one-page memo format compels writers to:
- Think clearly and logically
- Prioritize essential information
- Communicate goals, recommendations, and outcomes concisely

This approach benefits readers—especially executive directors, volunteers, and board members—by reducing the time needed to understand an issue or make a decision.

## Case Study: Amazon's Memo Culture

At Amazon, narrative memos replaced PowerPoint presentations as a primary communication tool. Jeff Bezos implemented this policy to force clarity of thought among teams.

> "The traditional kind of corporate meeting starts with a presentation. Instead, we silently read a six-page, narratively structured memo... and then we discuss it."  
> — *Jeff Bezos, 2018 Letter to Shareholders*

In fact, Amazon takes it one step further by **requiring memos to be well-structured, edited, and written for clarity**. Poor memos are rejected, and employees are expected to think deeply before sharing ideas. This standard raises the overall quality of communication and decision-making.

## Applying This to Food Pantry Operations

Food pantry operations can borrow from Amazon’s rigor without mimicking its corporate culture. A well-written one-page memo can:

- Document a supply chain issue and propose solutions
- Summarize a donor conversation or community partner opportunity
- Present a policy update for board approval
- Clarify the intent behind a field services initiative or outreach event

Here’s a suggested format:

```
To: [Recipient]  
From: [Author]  
Date: [MM/DD/YYYY]  
Subject: [Concise Subject Line]

1. Summary of the issue  
2. Background or context  
3. Recommendation or proposed action  
4. Next steps  
```

## Why It Matters for Open Source Food Pantries

Open source means distributed participation. That’s why **shared communication norms matter even more**. When everyone understands how to quickly digest a memo or propose an idea in one page, collaboration accelerates—even across organizations.

We believe that open source food pantries can raise their collective effectiveness by adopting this memo style for internal and external communication.
