## Overview

This document proposes a grassroots fundraising strategy based on collecting small contributions from a large group of supporters. This method aligns with the mission of community-focused nonprofits and offers a scalable, resilient, and inclusive path to financial sustainability.

## Rationale

A growing body of research and real-world examples supports this approach:

- **Obama 2008 Campaign**  
  Raised over $500 million from small-dollar donors, with nearly half of all donations under $200.  
  *Source:* [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/11/05/obama.fundraising/index.html)

- **NPR (National Public Radio)**  
  Relies heavily on listener donations—many under $10/month—demonstrating the power of mass micro-giving.  
  *Source:* [NPR Finances](https://www.npr.org/about-npr/179876898/public-radio-finances)

- **Wikipedia & Charity: Water**  
  Built sustainable funding models on high-volume, low-dollar contributions by emphasizing transparency and public ownership.

- **2023 M+R Benchmarks Report**  
  Nonprofits with small-dollar recurring donors saw:  
  - Higher donor retention (monthly donors were 3x more likely to renew)  
  - More predictable revenue  
  - Lower fundraising overhead

## Benefits for Food Pantries

- **Stability:** Recurring donations improve budget forecasting and reduce reliance on one-time gifts.  
- **Scalability:** Easier to grow through social media and word-of-mouth.  
- **Inclusivity:** Allows all community members to participate.  
- **Resilience:** Distributes funding risk across many donors.

## Recommendations

1. Launch a branded recurring donation campaign (e.g., *“Neighbors for $10”*).
2. Use QR codes, mobile-friendly platforms, and email to encourage giving.
3. Train volunteers and staff to promote micro-giving to their networks.
4. Publicly recognize all donors, regardless of amount, to foster community pride.

## Conclusion

Micro-donation strategies have empowered nonprofits across the country to scale and thrive. By adopting this model, food pantries can build a reliable and inclusive base of support.
